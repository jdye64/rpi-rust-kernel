# BCM2837 Rust Kernel

This project is a simple and non practical example for my personal learning of how to write a baremetal Rust kernel for the BCM2837 chip (AKA Raspberr PI).

This example kernel simply demonstrates a "blinking LED". To accomplish this of course a LED must be attached to GPIO pin 21 on your Raspberry PI device through a breadboard and a 470 ohm resistor back to GROUND on the Raspberry PI device.

## Assumptions
- Rust is installed on your development environment
- If on Ubuntu you have `binutils-arm-non-eabi` installed or the equivalent for your development machine operating system. You can installed on Ubuntu by running `sudo apt install binutils-arm-none-eabi`

## Building Kernel
- Add the rust target for armv7a - `rustup target add armv7a-none-eabi`
- Compile the arm target - `cargo rustc -- -C link-arg=--script=./linker.ld`
At this point you are left with a ELF file named `my-rusty-pi`, this file is understood by Linux. However, for embedded development we need to export the executable contents of the ELF to a purely binary file. We do this by running `arm-none-eabi-objcopy -O binary target/armv7a-none-eabi/debug/my-rusty-pi ./kernel7.img`

The `kernel7.img` file along with `fixup.dat`, `start.elf`, and `bootcode.bin` (which were pulled from https://github.com/raspberrypi/firmware/tree/master/boot) can be written to a SD card and inserted into the Raspberry PI. If you have completely your wiring correctly when you boot the RPI device the LED light should blink as expected.
